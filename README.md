# PROJECT_WEBRTC


The aim of my project is to provide an efficient web application for video conferencing with webRTC.As everyone is being forced to work and socialise from home video chat has become incredibly important and zoom like App has been consistently criticized for their poor security and privacy ,so this project come up with the creation of video chat App with webRTC.
    The important aspect of my project is by integrating webRTC in video conferencing solution which supplies the real-time communication capabilities and ensure security by encrypting all the data that it sends by default. Additionally, access to media devices is only granted through the HTTPS protocol, ensuring that only secure connections can communicate.Do not need to  create accounts in a third-party platform to use the services.It enhance the voice and video quality and exchange arbitary data between local computer browsers without requiring an intermediary.
    It is Java Script (front-end) and Node.js (back-end) project.
